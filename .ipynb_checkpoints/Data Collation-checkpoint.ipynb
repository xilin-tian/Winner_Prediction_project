    "The purpose of this document is to process the different datasets collected from the website. We obtained the records of the teams that made it to the Worlds for the entire year as well as other tournament data from [oracleselixir](https://oracleselixir.com/), and then from [League_of_Legends_Esports_Wiki](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Esports_Wiki) to get the wins and losses for each game of the Worlds each year, starting with the main tournament. In total, data was collected for a total of 5 years from 2019-2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "A total of 16 teams compete each year. In order to concatenate the two datasets together, we decided to subtract the data of the red team from the data of the blue team for each game to get the difference between the two teams as the INDEPENDENT variable of the dataset; and whether the blue team wins or not as the DEPENDENT variable of the dataset. thus we obtain a new dataset that will be based on the predicted the winning percentage of the blue team for further analysis."
